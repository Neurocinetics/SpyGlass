# Greetz

J5 && Root.

# Details

- To install, you will need pycryptodome, I would strongly advise looking over the instructions for that. 
- depends on the requests module.
- designed to be modular, with the end user in mind. Still working on the plugins portion, but once thats complete this will support dynamic loading of custom plugins.
- requires a pre-shared API key to use. (This api key is for purchase.)

# What is CloudGaze?

Cloudgaze is the end all be all, think shodan + google + leakix in one database. This(CloudGaze) tool crawls the greater internet of everything. Basically, a DB full of over 45 million unique ip addresses that have been crawled and indexed(this primarily focuses on web ports, more will be added in the future.

There is no GUI on the website. This is designed from the ground up to be utilized in the terminal.

Utilizing this tool, it streamlines the whole process. You can tap into the database looking for a single ip address, or multiple addresses. The choice is entirely yours as shown below:

# Future editions
- Will include SSL fingerprints, and search by SSL key (fingerprints, etc).
- Will include DNS information, and the ability to search by domain name.
- (the above are already written, i just need to add them to the crawler rotation and as a call within the api itself.)
